# GravitySim
WIP!
Accurate gravitational force simulator - physically accurate. You can add planets, with starting velocities and different sizes (textures randomized based on size).
You can switch to follow cam with "p" (but you currently can't get out again)

## Plans:

- Follow cam fixes and UI
- Explosions on collisions!
- Idk what else tbh
